# SlapMetro

A port to Swift of an objective-c project I wrote to email my wife in case of train
or subway issues. She has an iPhone but not very tech savy. Will read email before
trying an app. It's a universal app for iPhone or iPad. The send to and CC for email are configurable in settings.

Swift 3 Xcode 8.2.1 IOS 10.2
